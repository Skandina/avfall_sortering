Milk packages can usually be recycled in the paper recycling bin. However, it is important to remove any plastic caps or straws before recycling. Rinse out the milk package with water and let it dry before placing it in the recycling bin. If you are unsure whether your local recycling program accepts milk packages, you can check with your waste management company or local government.
